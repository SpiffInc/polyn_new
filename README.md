# PolynNew

Generates a new Polyn Admin codebase to be used for maintaining NATS server schemas and migrations

## Installation

### Install Elixir

The Elixir site maintains a great [Installation Page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) to help.

If we have just installed Elixir for the first time, we will need to install the Hex package manager as well. Hex is necessary to get a Phoenix app running (by installing dependencies) and to install any extra dependencies we might need along the way.

### Install Hex Package Manager

Here's the command to install Hex (If you have Hex already installed, it will upgrade Hex to the latest version):

```bash
mix local.hex
```

### Install polyn_new

```bash
mix archive.install hex polyn_new
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/polyn_new>.
